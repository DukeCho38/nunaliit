        <h3>Welcome to Nunaliit.</h3>

<p>The Nunaliit Atlas Framework aims to make it easy to tell stories and highlight relationships between many different forms of information from a variety of sources, using maps as a central way to connect and interact with the data.</p>

<p>The Nunaliit Atlas Framework was born out of a multi-disciplinary research project led by Dr. Fraser Taylor, a Distinguised Research Professor in the department of Geography and Environmental Studies and director of the <a href="http://gcrc.carleton.ca">Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre</a> at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.</p>

<h3>Map makers</h3>

<p>Nunaliit has been designed to make it relatively simple to create interactive mapping web sites based on your data and multimedia, and to permit web users to contribute additions and changes where permitted. By default, it uses a very flexible document oriented database (<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a>) to store any text-based attributes or data objects.</p>

<p>Altas creators may create a series of "schemas" to help define how to display and input documents that share a common set of attributes including geometries and relationships to other schemas. This flexible system allows for iterative development of functionality as you begin to see patterns in the data. Your editor users can create their own attributes and provide any sort of attachment. As the data evolves, schemas and atlas functionality can be modified to accomodate attributes or attachment types that might not have been originally anticipated.</p>

<p>Documents can have any number of attachments such as zip files, images, videos, office documents, mapping data, etc. Many popular image, video, sound, and location formats can be accepted and converted to web-ready formats by the Nunaliit server-side automatically.</p>

<p>A modern HTML/CSS/JS web client with OpenLayers mapping functionality is served to a user's browser and interacts with the database and a handful of media conversion servlets to permit rich interactivity with the data and editing/uploading of content and map geometries.</p>

<p>To get started with <em>using</em> Nunaliit, please <a href="http://central.maven.org/maven2/ca/carleton/gcrc/nunaliit2-couch-sdk/0.2.1/">download the pre-built binaries</a> from our Maven repository.</p>

<h3>Developers</h3>

<p>Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/GCRC/nunaliit">Nunaliit project on GitHub</a> to delve into the code, report problems, or suggest enhancements.</p>

<h3>Licence</h3>

<p>As an output of a publically funded research project, it was important for us to release the Nunaliit code under a license that permits broad adoption of the software and encourages use of the ideas as widely as possible. We have chosen the New BSD License as it permits use, redistribution, and modification by anyone with no obligation to make the modifications available for others. That being said, we expect that individuals and organizations, whether for profit or not, will see the benefits of contributing their effort back to the nunaliit community.</p>
